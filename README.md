## Dotfiles-Starter

This project is a boilerplate and should be use as a starting point for your dotfiles.

1. Download the repo on your machine.
2. Create a new public repository call `dotfiles` on your personal Github.
3. Update the `git/gitconfig` with your name and email.
4. Push the change on your personal Github repo.

Spin should now clone your personal dotfiles when you create a new workspace.
